A basic flask boilerplate for personal projects.

## Features
- Premade templates and routing for Home, Blog, About, Signup, Login and Logout pages.
- CSS styling for all of the above included.
- Preset connection to a database - either Postgres or SQLite, with SQLite being the default. This can be changed in the 'connections.py' file.
- A basic SQLite database with a 'users' table.
- A 'User' class that utilizes the database info via SQLAlchemy.

## Background
I really just wanted a clean version of some of the features and pages that I use frequently for apps, and the CSS already mostly taken care of.

## Todo
- Clean up the CSS classes.
- Possibly add a settings/user profile management page.
